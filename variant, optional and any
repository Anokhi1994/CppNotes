what is the use of std::any?
* std::any will be the right choice if you want to have an container with 
  an arbitary type. Types must be copyable though. 
  example: std::vector<std::any> anyVec(true,2017,std::string("test"),3.14,MyClass());
  
 What is the use of std::optional?
  * When you want to represent a nullable type nicely
      - rather than using unique values like -1, nullptr etc
      - for optional parameters
  * Return a result of some computation that fails to produce a value 
     and is not an error
     
 what is the use of std::vairant?
  * it is type-safe union
  
 what is common in std::any, variant and optional?
 * you can construct them in-place.
