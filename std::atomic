What exactly is std::atomic?
  * Anything with std::atomic<> is an atomic object. 
  * Each instantiaion of std::atomic<> represents a type that different threads 
    can simultaneously operate on without raising undefined behaviour. 
  * Ojbects of atomic types are the only C++ objects that are free from data races. 
  * If one threads writes to an atomic object while another thread reads from it, 
      the behaviour is well-defined. 
  * Accesses to atomic objects may establish inter-thread synchronization and 
    order non-atomic memory accesses as specified by std::memory order.
